    "# 🏢 Workday Health Reasoning Platform\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sedentary work is one of the most underestimated modern health risks.**  \n",
    "The World Health Organization reports that **31% of adults worldwide (≈1.8 billion people)** are insufficiently physically active — a pattern strongly linked to chronic disease risk and premature mortality. WHO also warns that insufficient physical activity is associated with a **20–30% higher risk of death**, and recommends actively reducing sedentary time throughout the day.  \n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, long screen exposure has become the default. Digital Eye Strain (Computer Vision Syndrome) is widely reported among screen users, causing symptoms such as **dry eyes, blurred vision, headaches, and difficulty focusing**, especially when workdays are built around uninterrupted monitor time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The result is a predictable cycle for desk workers:  \n",
    "**back and neck pain → fatigue → low productivity → stress → worse sleep → repeat.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Workday Health Reasoning Platform** is a **privacy-first, local-only, context-aware preventive health assistant** designed specifically for office and remote desk workers.  \n",
    "It helps users reflect on their daily workplace behaviors (posture, hydration, stress, eye strain, productivity, musculoskeletal symptoms, sleep recovery, and longitudinal lab trends) and then produces **clear, non-diagnostic, evidence-aligned recommendations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This platform is not a symptom checker and does not attempt to replace clinicians.  \n",
    "Instead, it acts as a **structured reasoning layer** between everyday work habits and actionable prevention — translating scattered inputs into practical steps, reminders, and habit nudges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🎯 Problem & Target Users\n",
    "\n",
    "### The problem\n",
    "Desk work concentrates multiple risk factors into a single routine:\n",
    "- prolonged sitting and low movement,\n",
    "- poor posture and repetitive strain,\n",
    "- screen-based eye fatigue and headaches,\n",
    "- mental overload, stress, and burnout patterns,\n",
    "- inconsistent hydration, recovery, and sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many existing tools either:\n",
    "- collect health data without generating meaningful guidance, or\n",
    "- rely on cloud-based processing that compromises privacy and user control.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target users\n",
    "- Office and remote desk workers  \n",
    "- Knowledge workers with long screen hours  \n",
    "- Professionals with chronic fatigue, posture pain, or eye strain  \n",
    "- Health-conscious users who value **privacy, autonomy, and clarity**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## ✨ Key Features\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modular Health Tabs**  \n",
    "  Baseline, Workspace, MSK, Eye, Mental, Hydration, Productivity, Recovery/Sleep, Checklist, Reminders.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Local-Only Storage (Privacy by Design)**  \n",
    "  All user data is stored locally as JSON — no automatic uploads, no hidden telemetry.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context-Aware Reasoning**  \n",
    "  The system builds a cross-domain context from real user inputs, allowing the assistant to detect patterns (e.g., hydration + headaches + screen time + poor sleep).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Safety Guardrails**  \n",
    "  Explicit checks for high-risk signals (e.g., severe symptoms, mental distress keywords, extreme values) to trigger urgent warnings.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optional AI Integration (Graceful Fallback)**  \n",
    "  Uses a language model only when configured; otherwise runs locally with safe placeholder logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Actionable Output, Not Just Tracking**  \n",
    "  Generates clear recommendations plus structured **tasks and reminders** that convert insight into daily behavior change.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Internationalization (i18n)**  \n",
    "  Built-in multilingual support (English & Arabic included), designed for global deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🧠 Architecture & Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The platform is built around a simple but powerful principle:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collect structured user inputs → build contextual memory → apply reasoning → output practical prevention guidance.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each module stores user entries and AI outputs in domain-specific JSON files.  \n",
    "A lightweight shared context layer allows cross-domain summaries without exposing raw histories, enabling explainable reasoning while maintaining performance and privacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook is a **self-contained, executable skeleton** demonstrating:\n",
    "- how user health inputs are collected,\n",
    "- how context is constructed across domains,\n",
    "- how safe reasoning is applied,\n",
    "- and how the full system runs locally with optional AI support.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌍 Why This Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Workplace health is not only a medical issue — it is a productivity and sustainability issue.  \n",
    "Preventable desk-work habits contribute to pain, fatigue, reduced concentration, and long-term chronic risk.  \n",
    "By turning routine behaviors into actionable guidance, this platform helps individuals regain control over their health **without giving up their data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "**help desk workers build healthier workdays — one small decision at a time.**\n"

    "Internationalization (i18n): Handles loading language files and providing a translation function.\n",
    "Safety Checks (safety.py): Provides functions to detect urgent health or mental health flags in user inputs.\n",
    "Input Registry (input_registry.py): Defines which data files are considered \"canonical\" user inputs for global analysis.\n",
    "Context Manager (context_manager.py): Manages summarized context memory for each domain (stores short summaries to be used across sessions or for global recommendations).\n",
    "Gemini API Client (gemini_client.py): Placeholder client to interface with the Gemini LLM API (with a safe fallback if not configured).\n",
    "OCR Pipeline (ocr_pipeline.py): Utility for optical character recognition on files (using Gemini's multimodal capabilities).\n",

    "This module (storage.py) defines the LocalStore class, which provides methods for local persistence of data. It stores JSON data and text files under the configured data directory. Key features: - Initialization: Accepts a data directory path and ensures it exists. - Save/Load JSON: Methods save_json(name, obj) and load_json(name) to write and read JSON files (using json.dump/json.load). If a file doesn't exist, load_json returns a default value. - Save/Load Text: Similar save_text and load_text methods for plain text, used for storing things like last AI outputs. - Utility: A helper last_output_name(domain) to standardize filenames for the last output of a given domain (e.g., 'baseline_last.txt').\n",

    "Safety Checks\n",
    "The safety.py module provides simple functions to detect urgent health concerns in the user's input: - bp_red_flag(systolic, diastolic): Checks blood pressure readings. If either systolic ≥ 180 or diastolic ≥ 120, it returns a flag (True) with a warning message indicating a hypertensive crisis (advising prompt medical attention). Otherwise it returns False with no message. - mental_red_flag(text): Checks a piece of text for certain keywords that suggest severe distress or suicidal ideation (like \"suicide\", \"kill myself\", \"can't go on\", etc.). If any such phrase is found, it flags True with a message urging the user to seek immediate help. - apply_safety_checks(payload): Given a dictionary of user input fields (e.g., might contain 'bp' for blood pressure and 'free_text' for user-entered text), this function runs all relevant checks. It aggregates any flags into a list payload['safety_flags'] and returns the payload. Tabs like the baseline or mental health tab can use this to check if the user's data contains any urgent issues and ensure the UI can alert the user appropriately.\n",

Returns the updated context dict. - delete_domain(store, domain): Removes a domain from the context summaries (for example, if one wants to reset context for that domain) and saves changes. - compose_relevant_context(store, domains): Given a list of domain names, it fetches their summaries and composes a single string with each domain's summary on a new line (prefixed by the domain name).

    "Gemini API Client\n",
    "The gemini_client.py module provides a wrapper for interacting with the Google Gemini API (a large language model). In this skeleton, it functions as a placeholder with a fallback if no API key is configured: - GeminiResponse (dataclass): A simple container for responses, holding the generated text, the model name, and a used_fallback flag indicating if the result is a placeholder. - GeminiClient class: - Initialization (__init__): Attempts to retrieve an API key from the environment (GEMINI_API_KEY). If found, it sets up a genai.Client (from Google's genai library) for the specified model. If no key is present, it marks the client as disabled (self.enabled=False), meaning actual API calls won't be made. - generate(prompt, response_language): If the client is enabled, it sends the prompt to the Gemini model (with an instruction to respond in the given language) and returns the model's response as a GeminiResponse. If not enabled (no API key), it returns a GeminiResponse with a placeholder text (indicating Gemini is not configured). - generate_with_file(prompt, file_path, response_language): Similar to generate, but allows including a file (image or PDF) in the prompt. It reads the file bytes and sends them along with the prompt to the model. If not enabled, returns a placeholder response. There's also an internal helper _detect_mime to determine the file's MIME type (only certain types are supported).\n",
    "All tabs use gemini.generate() (and some use gemini.generate_with_file()) to get AI-generated insights. In the absence of a real API key, the calls will just produce placeholder messages, which is suitable for testing the UI flow."

    "User Interface (Gradio) Setup\n",
    "The main user interface is defined in the app.py module. This script ties together the core components and the tabs within a Gradio app. Key points about app.py: - It uses Gradio Blocks to build the interface and define the layout (with a title, some description, and tabs). - It loads environment variables from a .env file (if present) via load_dotenv() to configure things like API keys. - It initializes the core services: a LocalStore for data storage and a GeminiClient for AI (which will be disabled if no API key is set). - It sets up a state variable lang_state to keep track of the current language (with default from config.DEFAULT_LANG). This state can be updated by the UI (e.g., if a language switcher were implemented) and is passed to tabs so they know what language to generate responses in. - Header: The app displays a title and subtitle using Markdown, pulling the text from the locale files via the translation function t(...). It also shows a notice about data being local-only (also from locales, likely msg.local_only). - Tabs: The interface is organized into tabs using gr.TabItem. The first tab is a general \"🏢 General Recommendations\" tab (the Action Center) which is built by build_global_recommendations_tab(...). Then, the app dynamically creates tabs for each domain by iterating over the TAB_BUILDERS list (imported from the tabs package). For each entry (which has a translation key for the title and the corresponding build function), it opens a new tab and calls the builder function with the necessary parameters (store, gemini, etc.). This way, all tabs are added to the UI. - Finally, the build_app() function returns the constructed Gradio Blocks app (assigned to demo in the code). If the script is run as __main__, it calls build_app() and then launches the app with app.launch(...) on the specified host and port.\n",

    "Tabs Implementation\n",
    "The application includes numerous tabs, each corresponding to a specific aspect of health or app functionality. Each tab is built by a function (e.g., build_baseline_tab) that creates Gradio interface elements and defines how user inputs are handled. All tab builder functions accept the same parameters: the store (for data persistence), gemini (for AI calls), lang_state (to track the current language), and locales_dir (for translations). They typically load any previously saved data, set up input fields (numbers, text boxes, sliders, etc.), and define output displays or actions (like generating a summary or saving data).\n",
    "The tabs can be grouped into categories:\n",
    "General Assessment: Baseline, Workspace, Longitudinal – initial assessments, workspace setup info, and long-term tracking of health metrics.\n",
    "Health Domains: Musculoskeletal (MSK), Eye, Mental, Hydration – domain-specific health tracking (e.g., exercise/posture, eye strain, mental well-being, water intake), each providing recommendations or summaries related to that domain.\n",
    "Work & Rest: Productivity, Recovery/Sleep – tracking work productivity and rest/sleep quality, offering suggestions to balance work and recovery.\n",
    "Action Plans: Checklist, Reminders – execution-oriented tabs; a checklist for healthy tasks and a reminders schedule for routine health activities.\n",
    "Meta/Utility: Context, Reports, Settings, Help – supporting features, including viewing aggregated context summaries, generating overall reports, adjusting settings (like clearing data), and viewing help information.\n",
    "We will go through each tab module below, showing its code and describing its functionality.\n",
    "General Recommendations Tab\n",
    "This tab (the \"Action Center\") aggregates inputs from all domains and provides overall health recommendations. It loads recent outputs or context from each domain and uses the AI to generate general advice. It may highlight urgent issues (safety flags) and give the user a summary of what to focus on."

       "\n",
       "The physical workspace plays a central role in musculoskeletal health, comfort,\n",
       "and sustained productivity. Desk-based work often involves prolonged sitting,\n",
       "repetitive movements, and fixed postures that can gradually place strain on the\n",

       "\n",
       "This module is designed to support **workspace and posture awareness**, not\n",
       "diagnosis. It helps identify everyday environmental and ergonomic factors that may\n",

       "\n",
       "### What this module captures\n",
       "- Type of workspace (office, home, shared)\n",
       "- Chair and desk setup\n",
       "- Screen height and viewing distance\n",
       "- Keyboard and mouse positioning\n",

       "- Posture-related discomfort or pain signals\n",
       "- Use of ergonomic supports (chair, stand, external devices)\n",
       "\n",
       "### Why this matters\n",
       "Poor ergonomics rarely cause sudden injury. Instead, strain typically accumulates\n",
       "through small mismatches between the body and the work environment—such as low\n",
       "screens, unsupported seating, or long periods without movement.\n",

       "Over time, these factors can contribute to musculoskeletal discomfort, reduced\n",

       "\n",
       "### How AI is used in this section\n",
       "The AI provides **non-diagnostic, preventive guidance** focused on:\n",
       "- Practical ergonomic adjustments for desk-based work\n",
       "- Posture and movement reminders that fit real workdays\n",

    "Desk-based work places sustained demands on attention, emotional regulation, and\n",

    "signals—often before individuals consciously recognize them.\n",

    "This module is designed to support **mental wellbeing awareness**, not diagnosis.\n",
    "It helps identify daily patterns related to stress, cognitive fatigue, and emotional\n",
    "load in the context of work routines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What this module captures\n",
    "- Perceived stress level\n",
    "- Mood state\n",
    "- Mental energy and brain fog\n",
    "- Focus quality and workload perception\n",
    "- Distractions (internal vs external)\n",
    "- Burnout warning signs (detachment, overwhelm)\n",
    "- Sleep quality and coping mechanisms\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why this matters\n",
    "Mental fatigue and burnout rarely appear suddenly. They typically develop through\n",
    "small, repeated stressors combined with insufficient recovery. Desk work can\n",
    "intensify this process due to prolonged screen exposure, cognitive overload, and\n",
    "blurred boundaries between work and rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "By reflecting on daily mental signals, this module helps highlight trends that may\n",

    "consequences occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How AI is used in this section\n",
    "The AI provides **supportive, non-diagnostic guidance** focused on:\n",
    "- Simple grounding and reset techniques\n",
    "- Burnout prevention through small, realistic actions\n",
    "- Improving coping strategies during demanding workdays\n",
    "- Practical sleep hygiene recommendations\n",
