ABOUT_APP_MD = """# 🏢 Workday Health Reasoning Platform

## Overview

**Sedentary work is one of the most underestimated modern health risks.**  
The World Health Organization reports that **31% of adults worldwide (≈1.8 billion people)** are insufficiently physically active — a pattern strongly linked to chronic disease risk and premature mortality. WHO also warns that insufficient physical activity is associated with a **20–30% higher risk of death**, and recommends actively reducing sedentary time throughout the day.  

At the same time, long screen exposure has become the default. Digital Eye Strain (Computer Vision Syndrome) is widely reported among screen users, causing symptoms such as **dry eyes, blurred vision, headaches, and difficulty focusing**, especially when workdays are built around uninterrupted monitor time.

The result is a predictable cycle for desk workers:  
**back and neck pain → fatigue → low productivity → stress → worse sleep → repeat.**

The **Workday Health Reasoning Platform** is a **privacy-first, local-only, context-aware preventive health assistant** designed specifically for office and remote desk workers.  
It helps users reflect on their daily workplace behaviors (posture, hydration, stress, eye strain, productivity, musculoskeletal symptoms, sleep recovery, and longitudinal lab trends) and then produces **clear, non-diagnostic, evidence-aligned recommendations**.

This platform is not a symptom checker and does not attempt to replace clinicians.  
Instead, it acts as a **structured reasoning layer** between everyday work habits and actionable prevention — translating scattered inputs into practical steps, reminders, and habit nudges.

## 🎯 Problem & Target Users

### The problem
Desk work concentrates multiple risk factors into a single routine:
- prolonged sitting and low movement,
- poor posture and repetitive strain,
- screen-based eye fatigue and headaches,
- mental overload, stress, and burnout patterns,
- inconsistent hydration, recovery, and sleep.

Many existing tools either:
- collect health data without generating meaningful guidance, or
- rely on cloud-based processing that compromises privacy and user control.

### Target users
- Office and remote desk workers  
- Knowledge workers with long screen hours  
- Professionals with chronic fatigue, posture pain, or eye strain  
- Health-conscious users who value **privacy, autonomy, and clarity**

## 🧠 Architecture & Data

The platform is built around a simple but powerful principle:

**Collect structured user inputs → build contextual memory → apply reasoning → output practical prevention guidance.**

Each module stores user entries and AI outputs in domain-specific JSON files.  
A lightweight shared context layer allows cross-domain summaries without exposing raw histories, enabling explainable reasoning while maintaining performance and privacy.

This notebook is a **self-contained, executable skeleton** demonstrating:
- how user health inputs are collected,
- how context is constructed across domains,
- how safe reasoning is applied,
- and how the full system runs locally with optional AI support.

MENTAL_WELLBEING_INFO_MD = """
# 🧠 Mental Wellbeing Module  
*Cognitive Load & Burnout Awareness*

Desk-based work places sustained demands on attention, emotional regulation, and
mental energy. Over time, high cognitive load, constant interruptions, and limited
recovery can contribute to stress accumulation, reduced focus, and early burnout
signals—often before individuals consciously recognize them.

This module is designed to support **mental wellbeing awareness**, not diagnosis.
It helps identify daily patterns related to stress, cognitive fatigue, and emotional
load in the context of work routines.

### What this module captures
- Perceived stress level
- Mood state
- Mental energy and brain fog
- Focus quality and workload perception
- Distractions (internal vs external)
- Burnout warning signs (detachment, overwhelm)
- Sleep quality and coping mechanisms

### Why this matters
Mental fatigue and burnout rarely appear suddenly. They typically develop through
small, repeated stressors combined with insufficient recovery. Desk work can
intensify this process due to prolonged screen exposure, cognitive overload, and
blurred boundaries between work and rest.

By reflecting on daily mental signals, this module helps highlight trends that may
affect productivity, wellbeing, and long-term resilience—before more severe
consequences occur.

### How AI is used in this section
The AI provides **supportive, non-diagnostic guidance** focused on:

- Burnout prevention through small, realistic actions
- Improving coping strategies during demanding workdays
- Practical sleep hygiene recommendations

The aim is to promote awareness, balance, and early prevention—not to replace
professional care.
"""
HYDRATION_INFO_MD = """
# 💧 Hydration & Kidney Health Module

Hydration plays a critical role in concentration, energy levels, kidney function,
and overall physical wellbeing—especially for people who spend long hours at a desk.
Mild dehydration is common in office settings and often goes unnoticed until symptoms
such as headache, fatigue, or brain fog appear.

This module is designed to move beyond simple “water tracking” by combining
**daily hydration behaviors** with **physiological bio-feedback signals**. Together,
these provide a more realistic picture of hydration status than intake alone.

### What this module captures

- Caffeine consumption (coffee, tea, energy drinks)
- Sugary drink intake
- Hydration habits (e.g., keeping a water bottle visible on the desk)
- Urine color indicator
- Thirst sensation
- Common dehydration symptoms (headache, brain fog, dizziness)

### Why this matters
Relying on thirst alone can be misleading, as thirst is often a **late signal**
of dehydration. Caffeine use, long screen time, and busy work routines can further
mask early warning signs.

By combining habits and body signals, this module helps identify patterns that may
affect productivity, comfort, and kidney health—without requiring perfect tracking
or medical interpretation.

### How AI is used in this section
